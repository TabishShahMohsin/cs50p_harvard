# Python figures out the type of the variable itself unlike c++. java, c, etc.
    # It's dynamicslly typed languge
    # Better for usage but not for bug detection
# Tool to check that the variables are storing the intended variable types

    # This int is an annotation/hint to the language, that this variable is an integer but not enforced so.

# Use mypy filename.py to check the types of variables
