# To Prevent coders form messing up the attributes
# As shown earliesr within coding you could use student.someotherthing="something"
    # This method can be used to bypass every condition related to the variable in __init__
    # To break this bypassing method we need to madate the coder to use to the setter and getter for data entry
# @property is a keyword in python
# decorators are the functions that modify behaviour of other functions

#Both the instance variable and function can't be called with a single name
    # Usually the instance variable is named as _house
        # and the property(fancier attribute) is called house

class Students:
    def __init__(self, Name, House):
        
        # As we are using dot notation here, it will also call the setter
        self.name=Name
        self.house=House
        
        #REMEMBER!!!!!!!!!!: self._house will not call the setter in initialization

    # The same name gives python the clue that this should have something to do with the property
    # But with 2 arguments
